# Applied Cryptography and Network Security

## Course content
Cryptography; symmetric and public-key, cryptographic protocols, key distribution, authentication, digital signatures. Network security; access control, services and mechanisms for authentication, network security protocols, application layer security.


## Learning outcome
### Knowledge
To get a basic understanding of principles and practice of cryptography and network security by gaining knowledge in four broad categories:

1) cryptographic algorithms.
2) techniques and algorithms for key management, key distribution and user authentication.
3) use of cryptographic algorithms in network protocols and network applications.
4) techniques for securing computers against intruders and malicious software.

### Skills

1) To be able to evaluate security of systems with respect to appropriate use of security services and mechanisms.
2) To be able to design basic security architectures through selection and integration of relevant security components.
